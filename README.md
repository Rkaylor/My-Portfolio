# My-Portfolio
## Programs Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap 4
***
This page was developed using the aforementioned developer tools.
Much of the code, including styling was implemented through bootstrap 4. While some styling was put in through css; bootstraps functionality allows for a lot of styling inline through its Divs and Classes. 
***
As a living document; with more knowledge and resources the page will evolve to include many more tools and implementations to eventually reach a desired state. I've continued implementing new techniques up to the deadline, and while this may have made the final outcome not as smooth as I had hoped it would be, I am able to say I'm learning more as I continue to tweak with the page itself.
